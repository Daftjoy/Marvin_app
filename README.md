This is my 42 web application for 42MÃ¡laga and 42Barcelona job search.
Marvin_Data app shows last 42 Madrid Events and actual number of students by searchin in 42Api.

To use the app you may need to create a .env file following the sample given, in which users
should fill client_id and client_secret variables with their unique data from 42. After that,
use docker-compose up to run the server at http://localhost:3000/ and explore the app.
